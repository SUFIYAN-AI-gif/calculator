# Simple Calculator in Python

This is my first Python project made as part of my learning journey. The calculator can perform two basic operations: Addition and Subtraction.

## What I Learned:
- Taking input from users
- Writing functions
- Using if-else logic
- Basic debugging and running Python code

## Tech Used:
- Python 3
- Terminal (Command Line)

More features like multiplication, division, and GUI might be added later.
